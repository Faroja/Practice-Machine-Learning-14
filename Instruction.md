Agglomerative Clustering & DBScan Exercise

- Perform EDA to understand the dataset.
- Explain about the insights obtained from EDA!

- For clustering, just drop the 'CustomerID' and 'Gender' features, then look for the best combination of 2 features based on their silhouette score which will then be used for clustering.
- Perform scaling using a standard scaler, then use the K-Means, Agglomerative clustering, and DBScan methods. Find the optimal number of clusters for each method.

- Compare the results of the three methods that have been tried, which method is the best?
- Interpret the clustering results!
